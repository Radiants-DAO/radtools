# Search & Navigation

## Purpose

Search and Navigation systems enable rapid discovery and keyboard-driven workflows throughout the app. As a native Mac application, RadFlow uses system-standard shortcuts plus Figma-inspired spatial navigation.

**Key Principle:** Git is the save function. Cmd+S commits. No ambiguity about what "save" means.

---

## Search Systems

RadFlow has two distinct search interfaces.

### Content Search (Cmd+F)
Find and navigate to content.

**Searchable Content:**
- Components (by name, category)
- Pages (by name, route)
- Design tokens (by name, value)
- Icons (by name, tags)
- Docs (by title, content)
- Colors (by name, hex value)

**Behavior:**
- Opens search overlay
- Type to filter results
- Results categorized by type
- Arrow keys to navigate
- Enter to jump to result
- Escape to close

**Result Actions:**
- Navigate to item on canvas
- Spotlight/highlight result
- Expand section if collapsed
- Switch canvas section if needed

### Prompt Builder (Cmd+E)
Contextual command palette for AI prompts.

**Concept:**
Select element(s) → Cmd+E → contextual quick prompts → Enter to copy

**Behavior:**
- Opens based on current selection
- Shows relevant quick prompts for selected element type
- Progressive prompt building
- Enter copies built prompt to clipboard
- Integrates with Prompts tab library

**Context Examples:**
- Button selected → "Change variant", "Update colors", "Add hover state"
- Multiple components selected → "Apply to all", "Make consistent", "Update spacing"
- Token selected → "Generate scale", "Find usage", "Suggest alternatives"

**Prompt Building:**
- Start with context (selected elements)
- Add modifiers from quick prompts
- Preview final prompt
- Copy or send directly to AI

## Canvas Navigation

### Zoom
Figma-quality zoom behavior.

**Controls:**
- Pinch to zoom (trackpad) — smooth, precise
- Scroll wheel zoom
- Cmd++ / Cmd+- for step zoom
- Cmd+0 to fit all
- Cmd+1 to zoom to 100%

**Quality Bar:** Must feel as good as Figma. No lag, no jitter.

### Pan
Move around the canvas.

**Methods:**
- Two-finger drag (trackpad)
- Spacebar + drag
- Middle mouse drag
- Arrow keys (when nothing selected)

### Section Navigation
Jump between canvas sections.

**Floating Pill Nav:**
- Persistent floating control
- Shows section names/icons
- Click to snap to section
- Current section highlighted

**Keyboard:**
| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Cmd+1 | Snap to Components section |
| Cmd+2 | Snap to Pages section |
| Cmd+3 | Snap to Docs section |
| Cmd+4 | Snap to Violations section |

### Mini Map
Navigation aid for large canvases.

**Features:**
- Thumbnail of entire canvas
- Current viewport rectangle
- Click to jump
- Collapsible
- Section boundaries visible

---

## Edit Mode Navigation

### Entering Edit Mode
Open items for detailed editing.

**From Canvas:**
- Select page/component/doc
- Press **E** to enter edit mode
- Or double-click item

**Behavior:**
- Canvas transitions out
- Edit view opens
- Snapshot taken for discard option
- Original state preserved until commit

### Page Editor Tabs
Multiple pages can be open.

**Behavior:**
- Each open page is a tab
- Single canvas view (only one canvas)
- Multiple page editor tabs allowed
- Tab shows page name + modified indicator

### Exiting Edit Mode

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Escape | Quick return to canvas (prompts if unsaved) |
| Cmd+S | Commit changes and return |
| Cmd+W | Close with "Commit or Discard?" prompt |

**Commit or Discard Dialog:**
- "You have unsaved changes to [Page Name]"
- [Commit] — saves to git, closes
- [Discard] — reverts to snapshot, closes
- [Cancel] — stays in editor

---

## Git as Save

### Core Concept
Every "save" is a git commit. No ambiguous local saves.

**Cmd+S Behavior:**
1. Stage changed files
2. Open commit message input (pre-filled with smart default)
3. Commit on Enter
4. Return to canvas

**Smart Commit Messages:**
- "Update Button primary variant colors"
- "Edit HomePage hero section"
- "Modify --color-primary token"

### Snapshot System
Preserve state for discard option.

**On Enter Edit Mode:**
- Snapshot current file state
- Store in memory (not git stash)
- Enable discard option

**On Discard:**
- Restore files to snapshot
- No git history created
- Clean return to canvas

*Note: Snapshot system needs separate detailed spec.*
